### Description
___

A native iOS implmentation of an image search engine. This app displays images retrieved from the unsplash API and displays them in a UICollectionView. Users can select an image an view in a larger capacity. This search engine also provides word suggestions and filters input of any non-alphabet numerical values
    
### Work Flow
___

To implment the word suggestions, I first wrote out the code in python to get a planned implmentation and then rewrote it in Swift. There were some setbacks as Swift is more modern and has many saftey features that prevented a fluid conversion. The word suggestion algorithm works by getting the frequencies of characters in every word in the dictionary. The user input is compared to the frequencies by individual index. The word with the most matched characters is returned.
